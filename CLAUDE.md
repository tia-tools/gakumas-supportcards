# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to a coding agent when working with code in this repository.

## Central Configuration

This template carries only the project-scoped scaffold: this CLAUDE.md skeleton, `docs/PLANS.md` (ExecPlan methodology), and `docs/adr/README.md` (ADR convention). Cross-project rules and the generic workflow skills (`grill-me`, `close-out`, `codebase-design`, `adopt-from-sibling`, `harvest-session`, `backlog`) live in the central `Taka499/claude` repository, deployed user-level at `~/.claude` — do not copy them into projects.

`docs/PLANS.md` is the one document that exists in both places. The canonical copy is `docs/PLANS.md` in `Taka499/claude`; the copy here is downstream and is checked in so a plan stays followable from a fresh clone with no `~/.claude`. Change the canonical one and propagate; see the note at the top of the file.

## Documentation

Project documentation lives in `docs/`. When creating or updating plans, ExecPlans, or design docs, save them there. Reference existing docs in `docs/` for context on project phases and milestones.

Every document should be self-sufficient: the reader should never need to hunt for context. Explain concepts inline. When a concept is already defined in another checked-in document, you may reference it by file path and section rather than repeating it — but the reference must be precise enough that the reader can find it immediately (e.g., "see `docs/PLANS.md` § Milestones"), not vague ("see the architecture doc").

## ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `docs/PLANS.md`) from design to implementation. ExecPlans are the persistence layer for cross-session development — they carry forward all context, decisions, and progress so that a fresh session can continue the work without loss. Completed plans are immutable history; when one finishes, run the close-out ritual (`close-out` skill) to extract its durable decisions before moving on.

## Durable Decisions (ADRs)

Cross-plan decisions live in `docs/adr/` (convention: `docs/adr/README.md`). This list is an index, not a home — one line per active decision with a pointer to its ADR; full context, provenance, and lifecycle live in the ADR file. Every non-obvious claim elsewhere in this file must cite its source (`per docs/adr/NNNN` or `per docs/plans/<plan>.md`) so this snapshot stays auditable and rebuildable. When an ADR corrects something an old plan asserted, the ADR wins.

- `docs/adr/0001-score-is-max-performance-parameter-gain-under-all-sp-route.md` — **accepted**: a card's 点数 is its expected Vo+Da+Vi gain over one run under a route profile where every lesson is an SP lesson and every conditional trigger is satisfied; SP発生率+ scores 0.
- `docs/adr/0002-game-skill-filter-table-is-the-canonical-effect-taxonomy.md` — **accepted**: effect categories come from the game's `SupportCardProduceSkillFilter.yaml`, never hand-defined; an unclassifiable effect fails the data build.
- `docs/adr/0003-owned-image-library-on-r2-served-through-the-app-worker.md` — **accepted**: thumbnails are extracted by us, named `img_general_{assetId}_full.webp`, stored in Cloudflare R2 and served by this app's Worker under `/img/*`.

## Project Overview

A static web page for 学園アイドルマスター players showing the サポカ凸別点数一覧: every support card as a row, its 点数 at 凸0 through 凸4 as columns, with a thumbnail that reveals the card name on hover, filterable by card type, plan and rarity. Points measure expected parameter gain over one run of a scenario (per `docs/adr/0001`), and the default scenario is H.I.F. (『Hatsuboshi IDOL FESTIVAL』) with 初LEGEND as the second shipped scenario. Scenarios are data files, not code, so a new game scenario is a new file (per `docs/plans/EXECPLAN_SUPPORT_CARD_SCORE_TABLE.md`). Card data is generated weekly from the `vertesan/gakumasu-diff` YAML dump; the app is deployed as a Cloudflare Worker under the tia-tools organisation at its own tia.run subdomain, with an in-app feedback form posting to the private `tia-tools/feedback` repository (same plan, decisions D7–D8).

## Architecture

<!-- Describe the high-level structure: key directories, how components relate, data flow. Name the main entry points. -->

## Setup and Development

<!-- How to install dependencies, configure the environment, and run the project locally. Include exact commands. -->

## Build and Test

<!-- List the commands to build, test, lint, and format. Show expected output for a clean run. -->

## Code Style

<!-- Language-specific conventions, naming patterns, import ordering, or formatting tools in use. -->

## Commit Discipline

- Follow Git-flow workflow to manage the branches
- Use small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones
- Only add and commit affected files; leave untracked files as they are
- Never add coding agent attribution in commits
